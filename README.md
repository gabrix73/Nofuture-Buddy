<h2>Why Use Age Instead of Ed25519/X25519/AES256-GCM?</h2>
<p>
  We preferred to use <strong>Age</strong> for several reasons:
</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Simplicity:</strong> Age provides a straightforward command-line interface for encryption and decryption without the complexities of manual key derivation and management.</li>
  <li><strong>Ease of Integration:</strong> By leveraging the official Age tool, we offload much of the cryptographic heavy lifting to well-maintained, audited code, reducing potential errors like <code>InvalidTag</code> issues.</li>
  <li><strong>Ephemeral Keys:</strong> The application generates temporary keys for each session, and once the session ends, these keys are lost forever, enhancing security.</li>
</ul>
<p></p>Age is designed primarily for encryption and decryption without built-in mechanisms for digital signatures and verification of the sender's identity.<br> 
Here‚Äôs why signing and verifying aren‚Äôt required within Age‚Äôs core design.<br>
<p></p>Along with the cryptographic protocols it uses:</p>
<ul>

<li>X25519:<br>
<p>Age uses the X25519 elliptic-curve Diffie‚ÄìHellman key agreement protocol to derive a shared secret between the sender and recipient. This shared secret is used to generate a symmetric key for encryption. X25519 handles key exchange securely but does not inherently provide a digital signature or verification of the sender. It's focused solely on establishing a secret key.</p></li>

<li>ChaCha20-Poly1305 (AEAD):<br>
<p>Once a shared key is derived via X25519, Age employs the ChaCha20 stream cipher for encryption combined with the Poly1305 authenticator. This combination‚Äîknown as an AEAD (Authenticated Encryption with Associated Data) scheme‚Äîensures that the ciphertext cannot be altered without detection. The Poly1305 tag verifies the integrity and authenticity of the message in the sense that any tampering would be detected, but it does not verify the identity of the sender. It only assures that the message hasn't been modified since encryption.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Because Age uses an AEAD scheme like ChaCha20-Poly1305, it provides:</p>
<ul>
<li>Confidentiality: The plaintext is kept secret.</li>
<li>Integrity: Any modification of the ciphertext can be detected.</li>
  </ul>
<b>However:</b>
<p>Age does not provide non-repudiation or authentication of the sender's identity through digital signatures. There's no built-in mechanism to cryptographically prove who sent the message.</p>
<p>
  Note that Age focuses on encryption/decryption without built-in signing. This decision was made for simplicity, as incorporating signing (like Ed25519) would add complexity. Our use case prioritizes easy text encryption/decryption alongside mainstream messaging apps.
</p>
<h2>Decryption Error: InvalidTag</h2>
<p>During the decryption process, users may encounter the InvalidTag error. 
  This error typically arises when the authentication tag appended to the ciphertext does not match the expected value during verification. 
  Possible causes include:</p>

Data Tampering: The ciphertext may have been altered or corrupted during transmission.
Incorrect Keys: Mismatched or incorrect encryption/decryption keys between paired sessions.
Nonce Reuse: Reusing nonces can compromise the security of the encrypted data, leading to authentication failures.

Resolution Steps:

Ensure Key Consistency: Verify that both parties are using the correct and matching key pairs.
Validate Data Integrity: Implement checks to ensure that the ciphertext remains unaltered during transfer.
Proper Nonce Management: Utilize unique nonces for each encryption operation to maintain security and prevent reuse.

üîß Technical Functionalities
Our application leverages robust cryptographic practices to ensure secure communication between paired sessions. 
Key features include:

Session Management: Create and manage unique sessions identified by Session IDs, facilitating secure pairing between users.
Buddy System: Pair two sessions to enable mutual encryption and decryption of messages, ensuring that only paired buddies can communicate securely.
Encryption/Decryption: Utilize authenticated encryption to protect message confidentiality and integrity, preventing unauthorized access and tampering.
In-Memory Data Protection: NOT YET IMPLEMENTED MemGuard to safeguard sensitive data in RAM, reducing the risk of memory scraping and data leakage.

ü§ù Why Adopt the Buddy System?
The Buddy System enhances security by establishing a trusted connection between two users. Benefits include:

Mutual Authentication: Ensures that both parties verify each other's identities before establishing a communication channel.
Secure Key Exchange: Facilitates the safe exchange of cryptographic keys without exposing them to potential interceptors.
Simplified Pairing: Streamlines the process of connecting users, making secure communication accessible and user-friendly.

üîí Why Libsodium with PyNaCl?
We chose Libsodium paired with PyNaCl for our cryptographic needs due to their proven security, performance, and ease of integration:

Proven Security: Libsodium is a well-regarded, high-security library trusted by the industry for implementing cryptographic operations.
Ease of Use: PyNaCl provides Python bindings for Libsodium, offering a simple and intuitive API for developers to implement encryption, decryption, and key management.
Performance: Both libraries are optimized for speed and efficiency, ensuring that cryptographic operations do not become a bottleneck in the application.
Comprehensive Features: Support for modern encryption algorithms, authenticated encryption, key exchange mechanisms, and secure memory management aligns with our security requirements.
